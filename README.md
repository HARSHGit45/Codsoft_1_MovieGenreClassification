## Movie Genre Classification Project
Welcome to the Movie Genre Classification project within the CodSoft Internship Experience! This project represents the successful completion of the first task, where the primary objective was to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying movie genres based on relevant features.

## Project Overview
In this project, we aimed to create a robust machine learning model that could accurately classify movie genres using a dataset containing relevant features. The dataset used for this project can be found (here)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb]. The dataset includes essential information about movies, serving as the foundation for our genre classification model.
